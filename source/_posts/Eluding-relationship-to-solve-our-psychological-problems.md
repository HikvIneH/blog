Thoughts in time while the preacher is leaving the hill. He gave no fuck about the hill, as they weren't separated no more as they are now holy. The relation between the preacher and the hill evolved around some serious emotional investment and constructive acts between both parties. 

Interpreting something that is already in your mind over and over again is tiring. One thing I've noticed is that part of our psychology involves in romanticization of our own thoughts and elide them for an actual solution for our own psychological problems. After that, we cried around the meaningless cycle of unnecessity. 

The preacher would never complains about the hill now, as their distance would not affect anything about their self-worth. The preacher would never complains now, because they will never get their emotional satisfaction. 
The preacher will never regret now, because there was the hill, and there was the preacher. And they weren't separated no more. They were one thing and that one thing is holy. 

Go on, preach it out, our tendency to romanticizing the relationship and elide them as an actual solution for our own psychological problem is bad.
