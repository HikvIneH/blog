## Meaningless Cycle

We all wake up in the morning and decides, what shoes we are going to put on, what shirt, what clothes, what pants, what underwear. All of this, to make us feel better about ourselves. What's going on here, truly, today is just a copy of yesterday. Doing the same things over and over again.
I'm kinda stuck on this same adventure of reality. I do have friends but I also presume that I was perfectly fine by being alone, to the point of total isolation. 

Having a sense of feeling better, then going back to your room with your perceptions that are in contraction, constricted, darkened and collapsed, having no idea of what was going on. Throwing yourself on to your bed, feeling stuck in that narrow and dark place to the next morning when we have our daily dose to decide what makes us feel better in the same meaningless cycle.

## Self Awareness

I'm aware that I'm not good at dealing with my own emotions. I find it hard to parse them out. In contrast, I find it easier to rationalize and make my way to understand another person's feeling. But the cost of that rationalization is that most of the times, my response in that situation seemed to be ineffective.

This feels like having a really bad myopia then losing my glasses in the free fall flow of the river flow while I can't take it back. And sometimes, you won't enjoy the musics and started to break down really bad, sobbing until you think you felt better. 

And then I went again into the same circle that throwing me into that dark and narrow place. My perception is not in contraction all of the times. I do like the isolation, to the point of I, waking up in the morning and decide. Thinking that I was perfectly fine by being alone is not wrong. But I realized that, I too, need social support to function normally, like the rest of us are. It only needs work for this consciousness to understand.

## Testament

This might be the hardship and joy of interpreting our own sadness. And the proper way of dealing with this, is that I should have called myself an expert in this domain of knowledge as I am continually experiencing this same meaningless cycle of being sad for years. As one would jubilate his way to the heavens must accept the depression unto death, I have to feel as much sadness as I want to feel the happiness.
