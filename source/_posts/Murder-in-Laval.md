The room is painted white, covered by yellowish stains of tobacco. It is darkened like no one is there, it doesn't allow any light to come inside. The window, there is only one window and it is closed by aluminum foils. The ventilation were bad but enough to keep this man alive, while the humid summer brings life to this place.

It seems that only the television appears to be awake, illuminating every feet it can reach. Moaning and groaning about life, and narrating tragedies over and over again thru the same program, each evening, each year. 

His dully eyes is hardly open, he got severe headache from the spirit last night... seldom he complains wether it is a night or day, as he kept himself darkened in the room. He is still there on his old sofa facing to the telly. He fell asleep by the cough syrup and woke up and alerted by some buzz feeling of the past. 

As they kept moaning, the headline news caught his attention. "Bresciano was found shot dead". 

He kept himself cool, he is a Canadian boy With ravaged limbs and wet soul. Trying to load up his voice as like he was trying to talk to someone. It seems like his throat is still dry as he said to himself... not melancholy, a bit grassy sound as like he has never been talking for ages. The sleep has got him really bad, as he says "fuck" sentimentally to himself because he hates his job.
