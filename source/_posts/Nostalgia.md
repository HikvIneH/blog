## Thoughts in time.
To explain the definition of some word I cannot recall is like remembering the summertime when the fire blazed in the sky as in our hearts. That feeling of nostalgia, not the word itself, but the thought of how it use to be. We sat together under the cool, starry sky as we held each other close like a moth to a flame. And now I sit here writing this with the sickening thought of how it use to be.

## Out of Season.
The weather is not new, we are still waiting for the summer rain before we reach for its dry breeze. Thoughts in time, longing for the beasts. They are waiting for us to come near, close and wide.
There is nothing new, we are still waiting for the feast of a designated victory. 
Out of season for a long summer, longing for change. They are here to take us. 
There is season was not changed, but this heart was renewed from that nostalgia.
