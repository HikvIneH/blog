“That’s right. Look! I am forty years old; I am twice as old as you, and I’ve seen twenty times as much as you. For three years long I wore my feet to the bone marching in the army. I have been married twice. I’ve been in the Caucasus, I know the Dukhobors. They’re not masters of life, no, they aren’t!”

The mother listened eagerly to his direct speech. It pleased her to have an older man come to her son and speak to him just as if he were confessing to him. But Pavel seemed to treat the guest too curtly, and the mother, to introduce a softer element, asked Rybin:

“Maybe you’ll have something to eat.”

“Thank you, mother! I’ve had my supper already. So then, Pavel, you think that life does not go as it should?”

Pavel arose and began to pace the room, folding his hands behind his back.

“It goes all right,” he said. “Just now, for instance, it has brought you here to me with an open heart. We who work our whole life long — it unites us gradually and more and more every day. The time will come when we shall all be united. Life is arranged unjustly for us and is made a burden. At the same time, however, life itself is opening our eyes to its bitter meaning and is itself showing man the way to accelerate its pace. We all of us think just as we live.”

“True. But wait!” Rybin stopped him. “Man ought to be renovated — that’s what I think! When a man grows scabby, take him to the bath, give him a thorough cleaning, put clean clothes on him — and he will get well. Isn’t it so? And if the heart grows scabby, take its skin off, even if it bleeds, wash it, and dress it up all afresh. Isn’t it so? How else can you clean the inner man? There now!”

Pavel began to speak hotly and bitterly about God, about the Czar, about the government authorities, about the factory, and how in foreign countries the workingmen stand up for their rights. Rybin smiled occasionally; sometimes he struck a finger on the table as if punctuating a period. Now and then he cried out briefly: “So!” And once, laughing out, he said quietly: “You’re young. You know people but little!”

Pavel stopping before him said seriously:

“Let’s not talk of being old or being young. Let us rather see whose thoughts are truer.”

“That is, according to you, we’ve been fooled about God also. So! I, too, think that our religion is false and injurious to us.”

Here the mother intervened. When her son spoke about God and about everything that she connected with her faith in him, which was dear and sacred to her, she sought to meet his eyes, she wanted to ask her son mutely not to chafe her heart with the sharp, bitter words of his unbelief. And she felt that Rybin, an older man, would also be displeased and offended. But when Rybin calmly put his question to Pavel, she could no longer contain herself, and said firmly: “When you speak of God, I wish you were more careful. You can do whatever you like. You have your compensation in your work.” Catching her breath she continued with still greater vehemence: “But I, an old woman, I will have nothing to lean upon in my distress if you take my God away from me.”

Her eyes filled with tears. She was washing the dishes, and her fingers trembled.

“You did not understand us, mother!” Pavel said softly and kindly.

“Beg your pardon, mother!” Rybin added in a slow, thick voice. He looked at Pavel and smiled. “I forgot that you’re too old to cut out your warts.”

“I did not speak,” continued Pavel, “about that good and gracious God in whom you believe, but about the God with whom the priests threaten us as with a stick, about the God in whose name they want to force all of us to the evil will of the few.”

“That’s it, right you are!” exclaimed Rybin, striking his fingers upon the table. “They have mutilated even our God for us, they have turned everything in their hands against us. Mark you, mother, God created man in his own image and after his own likeness. Therefore he is like man if man is like him. But we have become, not like God, but like wild beasts! In the churches they set up a scarecrow before us. We have got to change our God, mother; we must cleanse him! They have dressed him up in falsehood and calumny; they have distorted his face in order to destroy our souls!”

He talked composedly and very distinctly and intelligibly. Every word of his speech fell upon the mother’s ears like a blow. And his face set in the frame of his black beard, his broad face attired, as it were, in mourning, frightened her. The dark gleam of his eyes was insupportable to her. He aroused in her a sense of anguish, and filled her heart with terror.

“No, I’d better go away,” she said, shaking her head in negation. “It’s not in my power to listen to this. I cannot!”

And she quickly walked into the kitchen followed by the words of Rybin:

“There you have it, Pavel! It begins not in the head, but in the heart. The heart is such a place that nothing else will grow in it.”

“Only reason,” said Pavel firmly, “only reason will free mankind.”

“Reason does not give strength!” retorted Rybin emphatically. “The heart gives strength, and not the head, I tell you.”

The mother undressed and lay down in bed without saying her prayer. She felt cold and miserable. And Rybin, who at first seemed such a staid, wise man, now aroused in her a blind hostility.

“Heretic! Sedition-maker!” she thought, listening to his even voice flowing resonantly from his deep chest. He, too, had come — he was indispensable.

He spoke confidently and composedly:

“The holy place must not be empty. The spot where God dwells is a place of pain; and if he drops out from the heart, there will be a wound in it, mark my word! It is necessary, Pavel, to invent a new faith; it is necessary to create a God for all. Not a judge, not a warrior, but a God who shall be the friend of the people.”

“You had one! There was Christ!”

“Wait a moment! Christ was not strong in spirit. ‘Let the cup pass from me,’ he said. And he recognized Caesar. God cannot recognize human powers. He himself is the whole of power. He does not divide his soul saying: so much for the godly, so much for the human. If Christ came to affirm the divine he had no need for anything human. But he recognized trade, and he recognized marriage. And it was unjust of him to condemn the fig tree. Was it of its own will that it was barren of fruit? Neither is the soul barren of good of its own accord. Have I sown the evil in it myself? Of course not!”

The two voices hummed continuously in the room, as if clutching at each other and wrestling in exciting play. Pavel walked hurriedly up and down the room; the floor cracked under his feet. When he spoke all other sounds were drowned by his voice; but above the slow, calm flow of Rybin’s dull utterance were heard the strokes of the pendulum and the low creaking of the frost, as of sharp claws scratching the walls of the house.

“I will speak to you in my own way, in the words of a stoker. God is like fire. He does not strengthen anything. He cannot. He merely burns and fuses when he gives light. He burns down churches, he does not raise them. He lives in the heart.”

“And in the mind!” insisted Pavel.

“That’s it! In the heart and in the mind. There’s the rub. It’s this that makes all the trouble and misery and misfortune. We have severed ourselves from our own selves. The heart was severed from the mind, and the mind has disappeared. Man is not a unit. It is God that makes him a unit, that makes him a round, circular thing. God always makes things round. Such is the earth and all the stars and everything visible to the eye. The sharp, angular things are the work of men.”

The mother fell asleep and did not hear Rybin depart.

But he began to come often, and if any of Pavel’s comrades were present, Rybin sat in a corner and was silent, only occasionally interjecting: “That’s so!”

And once looking at everybody from his corner with his dark glance he said somberly:

“We must speak about that which is; that which will be is unknown to us. When the people have freed themselves, they will see for themselves what is best. Enough, quite enough of what they do not want at all has been knocked into their heads. Let there be an end of this! Let them contrive for themselves. Maybe they will want to reject everything, all life, and all knowledge; maybe they will see that everything is arranged against them. You just deliver all the books into their hands, and they will find an answer for themselves, depend upon it! Only let them remember that the tighter the collar round the horse’s neck, the worse the work.”
