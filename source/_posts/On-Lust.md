## Jokes on Hari Kartini
Pardon my ignorance. The fact that most women were submissive and men were likely to be dominant, should not be drawn into classification (we are human, all too human tho). 

Then, I think I would avoid someone like Kartini. But I got into thinking. Having to materialize women, putting them into subjects of our own desire. If we are looking for one classification. Having someone drawn into materials, subjects of our own desire, then it shall be illogical for us to have a wife material,since we are all too human to get our desires fulfilled. Like the biblical story when ...Christ went into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. There is a need for us to sacrifice our desires. 

Then I got again into thinking. We are all chasing for love, since we can not fulfill up into our strangest desires, then the concept of love will be admirations/pettyness into our own unfulfilled desires. Or is it fair to say that we are all being deceived by our unfulfilled desires?

then there is no need for us to love. bye xoxo
