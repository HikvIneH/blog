## Inspired or Depressed
"We perched headlong defying the curses and tragedies and it's not because of the snake or that tree of knowledge we are tempted, I told you, girl." Adam raised his voice as he began to leave the paradise.

"He just decides what he want, but he can't decide what he will decide. You are still in control, papa" whispered Eve to God as she prepared for his journey with Adam. 

I personally don't think that they have freewill either. Is it destiny? As they were all made up of atoms defying the law of action and reaction. As the birds, endlessly in flights. Human, still, human are all too human acting as human.

It still depth in thoughts, as rationalism and empiricism rather than inspiring or depressing. We are walking in the edge of some kind of inspiration of reasonings as we have the ability to innately make decision to discard or accept information upon reasoning. While on the other time, even with our capacity for those rational decisions. We are still depressed around our environment that shapes our decision making. I didn't choose my environment that reared and shaped my values and beliefs from which I act.  

## This place is ugly, dry and cold
You know, Zizek's jokes about video games, there is a house we can not enter. Not because it is not in the program, but more into our sinful soul that doesn't allow us to enter the place. Like God might have created us and might be underestimate our capability of understanding something, So "Fuck it, I won't write any more code today for you humans". 
A bit of history, we've shown that those concepts are evolved around us. Our decision making, our environments, rational thinkings and all of those good things we've ever experienced, created, are on the edge of boredom as they are waiting to be wiped.  
I want to choose the third way of thinking, a new alternative of seeing. A new confederacy that cooperates, something like super empirical to inspire and makes us depressed.
