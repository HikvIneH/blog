## Describing
Imagine about it is pretty difficult, let alone describing! 

## Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit
I've always seen that nothing, nothingness as a space or void in which nothing exist, nonexistents, emptiness between all matter. Whereas matter itself is any substance, mass that occupies space. Then comes the distinction from the term that mass will always have a lot of nothing between its molecules and atoms which leads us into a thinking that our Universe is simply a whole form of nothingness. 
Like the old latin saying "ex nihilo nihil fit" that means "Out of nothing, comes nothing".

## Inferno and Paradiso
Like Light and darkness often associated with good doings and evil doings. We love to classify things, as light would be in the class of silvery force of good like in all of those fictions and darkness would be the evil ones. In Science, light would be the form of photon particles, but it doesn't always means that darkness is the absence of those photon particles. 

Light doesn't always negates darkness like what good doings and evil doings did in our society. 
A room where we can't see anything, it doesn't mean that the cat can't see anything, because we've got different exposure of light with those cute kittens. 

I tried to defy my logic by thinking that there is no such a fight between good and evil, it was just standards given by our predecessor (like what Raskolnikov would think). But Heaven and Hell, like in Dante's Divine comedy, Virgil, the poet guides him through Hell and Purgatory, Beatrice, Dante's ideal woman, guides him through Paradise. I saw that it is more like life and death. 

A distinc premise where we can't have one without the other one. Like we identify white from a contrast comparison with black. Then the poet Virgil is just a contrast comparison to Beatrice as there will be no Paradiso without the Inferno. 

## Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky
The discussion of Nothingness went to Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky. I often find people who are rebellious would attracted more to Nietzsche and people who are religious would attracted more to Dostoyevsky. Nietzsche with his will to power and Dostoyevsky with his Raskolnikov's faithful remorse. 

Hamlet, on the other hand, with his popular saying "To be or not to be? that's the question". Is it really the question? From nothing comes nothing, but "is" can't be "isn't" without "isn't" in the first place. We can't determine an object without the space around it. We can't have something without nothing. We seen life as a contrast comparison from death. 

Nietzsche attempts to overcome nihilism with Zarathustra's trio of ideas, the Superman, the will to power and eternal recurrence. That one must enjoy nihilism or despaired enough to think that life is meaningless, an attitude towards the eternal recurrence for self-overcoming. 

These notion were tackled by Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov, an attitude against society, God and himself. Raskolnikov thinks that every Being must break the eternal recurrence for self-overcoming, but later, its a nonsense. Although, he found his way out with sufferings and faithful remorse.

Around nothingness, I come to think that "nothing", as Zarathustra enjoys the meaningless suffering life or Raskolnikov deliriously runnning for confession to face his suffering, will always conjugate our way through for a betterment, even in the thinking about nothing.   

Nothing...
