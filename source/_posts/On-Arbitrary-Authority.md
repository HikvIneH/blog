## The naration for this evening is not new.
Those birds, flying and tired. The wind is okay and the sky is clear. Looked like they soar too high as I can not see the way they put effort on that wings to move through the air. Seems like they enjoyed it, their endless flight.  I don't want to imagine it.  

After a while, as I walked to the west, the horizon appears in a way that it is about to leave this old world, circling around towards the new world. Then I hear a whispering, stuttering, preaching about this place that has everything. As those birds disappear and the sun disappears. The naration for this evening were never new, I'm walking thru and thru for the new world.  

## I've seen this cloudy smoke through and through.
"You know how smooth the raven's claw was? Before they leave us? Before they come?"
They are telling me, that it is free out there "Seldom you free from your sick cloudy smoke", "Let's take a ride with us" said the raven to the little Guinea Pig in the laboratory. "But I can't leave this place, this is my home. I was born here, this is my place"

## You might recall all of the rest.
The bird is flying, alone, as he want to seek for his own freedom, his own nothingness. He is seeking for something that is taken from him. He wants an arbitrary authority. But...(as he talks to himself) "We need tribe, we need tribal identity." 

"...We need to feel we belong in to, not just an **arbitrary authority**."
