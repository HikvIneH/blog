## Even the greatest stars, discover themselves in the looking glass
There are few attempts in writing about this Journey, yet I'm still circulating myself with contradiction, like the cycle of meaningless crushes I've encountered in life. Like a disappointed Kant on the reservation of his Critique of Pure Reason along with the confusion on Empirical Casualty. 

Kind of confession, a testament not only to the star but also widely attributed with normal folks. We stare at the abyss at the same time it stares back to us. A preferential choice that we choose within our causality of time-series. 

## I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
While our mind changes in every slice of time. We choose who we are by who we are from the past few minutes. Even though our mind really likes to take all of those credits, this conscious soul is what we are at each point in the implied time period.  

The confession of the star brings me into an insight that at each point in the implied time period, what we choose is grounded with our preferential value. 
Sometimes we see our face, sometimes a stranger in our face. Part of being strange is that, often, we reflect it with a social outcast, ugliness. 

Seclutions, isolations, an outcast. Staring at the mirror, trying to see from the other side beneath the insulated border. It seems like the abyss is pre-defined. Trying to stay away from the unattractive cliques. God setteth the solitary in families.

## The Last Man
The strangeness of the abyss brings everyone to the deepest side of ugliness. No more contemplating on right or wrong, it brings out a golden rule that everyone is strange and ugly in a seclution. But when the last man forgives and convey the unattractive truth, the abyss is then leaving and people start to remember **the journey with the abyss**. 

"...All actions of rational beings, as appearances, are strictly determined by causality. The same actions are free when the rational being acts as a thing–in– itself in accordance with mere practical reason." ~Prologema to any future metaphysics
